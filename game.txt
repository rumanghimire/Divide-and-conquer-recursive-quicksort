The ABC League needs you to write a well-structured and documented Java program to keep track of the standing in their league. To do this your program will take as an input file containing the performance in playing games. Rank in the league is determined by the number of points acquired by playing the games. If a team wins a game they receive 3 points, if they tie, or play to a draw, they receive 1 point and if they lose the receive 0 points. The output will be the teams in ranked order with the number of wins, draws, losses, and points earned. Your program must utilize and divide-and-conquer recursive quicksort to sort the team by points. If the team ties on points the team with the most wins is listed first if that is also the same the teams are listed in alphabetic order by team name. Example Input10Alexandria, 10, 4, 6  Baton Rouge, 8, 6, 7 Hammond, 9, 5, 8Lake Charles, 4, 6, 11 Monroe City, 14, 3, 4 Monroe United, 13, 3, 5 Shreveport, 16, 2, 2 New Orleans, 10, 10, 1 Start, 4, 3, 14 Sterlington, 12, 3, 7 Input Specs.Number of teamsThe line for each team consists of:Team Name, comma, wins, comma, draws, comma, loses Example Output Shreveport     16  2  2  50Monroe City    14  3  4  45Monroe United  13  3  5  42New Orleans   10 10  1  40Sterlington  12  3  7  39  Alexandria   10  4  6  34Hammond   9  5  8  32Baton Rouge   8  6  7  30Lake Charles  4  6 11  18Start  4  3 14  15Output Specs.Team names 15 spaces left justified.
